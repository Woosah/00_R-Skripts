  # sim.glmm: simulate responses from a GLMM.
  # Paul Johnson, Institute of BAH&CM, University of Glasgow
  # 30th September 2013
  #
  # v4.2:  
  #   - changes from v1: now allows random effect variances to be supplied
  #     as a vector as well as a matrix
  #   - changes from v2: fixed bug
  #   - changes from v3: add negative binomial ditribution
  #   - changes from v4 and 4.1: 
  #       fixed bug in formation of var-covar matrices of dimension 1
  #       changed unix/mac end of line so that Windows notepad shows EOL
  #
  # DETAILS:
  # the vector of responses is randomly simulated from a GLMM
  # and added to an input data set.
  # the values of the fixed effects, the random effects variances and 
  # covariances, and the response distribution are inputs. 
  #
  # ARGUMENTS:
  # design.data: a data frame containing all the data except the response.
  # fixed.eff: a list of fixed effects. fixed.eff$intercept has to be supplied.
  #   the names of the other elements should correspond to variables in design.data.
  #   for example, to specify a model of the form y ~ 10 + 2*(sex=="Female") + 0.5*age
  #   you would use fixed.eff=list(intercept=10,sex=c("Male"=0,"Female"=2),age=0.5).
  #   this should work as long as design.data has a factor called sex with 
  #   levels "Male" and "Female" and a numeric variable called age.
  #   if there are no fixed effects (other than the intercept) then fixed.eff should have only
  #   one element, "intercept".
  # rand.V: either (a) a vector of the variances of the random effects, where the
  #   names correspond to factors in design.data; or (b) the variance-covariance 
  #   matrix of the random effects, where the column and 
  #   row names correspond to factors in design.data.
  #   option (b) allows covariances between random effects to be specified.
  #   if rand.V is null the resulting response will be simulated without 
  #   random effects, i.e. from a GLM.
  # distribution: specifies the response distribution. currently has to be 
  #   gaussian, poisson, binomial or negative binomial. for all but poisson 
  #   some additional information must be supplied:
  #   gaussian: SD must be suppied.
  #   binomial: for a binomial response (x successes out of n trials), design.data must have a
  #     column named n to specify the number of trials. for binary data (0 or 1)
  #     use design.data$n should be a column of 1s. i haven't dealt with the 
  #     (realistic) scenario where both x and n vary randomly, although
  #     i guess the n could be simulated first as poisson then the x as binomial.
  #     how to analyse this properly is also not clear to me. The approach I would
  #     take is to simulate variation in n but ignore it in the analysis. This
  #     seems to work pretty well.
  #   negative binomial: theta, the overdispersion parameter, must be supplied. 
  #     theta is equivalent to "size" as defined in ?rnbinom. a poisson distribution
  #     with mean mu has variance mu. a negative binomial distribution with mean mu 
  #     and overdispersion parameter theta has variance mu + mu^2/theta.  
  # SD: the residual standard deviation where the distribution is gaussian.
  # drop.effects. default is TRUE. if drop.effects is FALSE, the fixed effects and  
  #    the random effect residuals will be output as additional rows in the data frame.
  #
  # VALUE:
  # the input data frame with the response vector added as a new variable called "response".
